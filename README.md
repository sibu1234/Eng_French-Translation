What is Machine Translation?
Machine translation (MT) refers to fully automated software that can translate source content into target languages. Humans may use MT to help them render text and speech into another language, or the MT software may operate without human intervention.

MT tools are often used to translate vast amounts of information involving millions of words that could not possibly be translated the traditional way. The quality of MT output can vary considerably; MT systems require “training” in the desired domain and language pair to increase quality.


Translation companies use MT to augment productivity of their translators, cut costs, and provide post-editing services to clients. MT use by language service providers is growing quickly.
